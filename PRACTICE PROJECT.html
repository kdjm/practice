                <p>Leh (/ˈleɪ/) is the joint capital and largest town of the union territory of Ladakh in India. Leh, located in the Leh
                    district, was also the historical capital of the Kingdom of Ladakh, the seat of which was in the Leh Palace, the former 
                    residence of the royal family of Ladakh, built in the same style and about the same time as the Potala Palace in Tibet. 
                    Leh is at an altitude of 3,524 m (11,562 ft), and is connected via National Highway 1 to Srinagar in the southwest and
                    to Manali in the south via the Leh-Manali Highway.

                <p>The city is located on the bank of the Indus. The mountains dominate the landscape around the Leh as it is at an altitude
                    of 3,500m. Peaks, such as Nanga Sago, can reach well above 5,500m. The principal access roads include the 434 km Srinagar-Leh
                    highway which connects Leh with Srinagar and the 428 km Leh-Manali Highway which connects Manali with Leh. Both roads 
                    are open only on a seasonal basis.[19] Although the access roads from Srinagar and Manali are often blocked by snow in 
                    winter, the local roads in the Indus Valley usually remain open due to the low level of precipitation and snowfall.
